## Overview

This configuration aims to provide a smooth and efficient experience for Neovim users. It is written in Lua and leverages modern plugins and features to streamline the development process.

## Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Neovim** (v0.8 or higher)
- **Git**: Required for managing plugins.
- **Node.js & npm**: For certain plugins.
- **Python 3**: Required for Python-based plugins.
- **ripgrep**: Enhances searching capabilities.
- **fd**: A simpler and faster alternative to `find`.

Install these dependencies using your preferred package manager.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your Neovim configuration directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaidARSLAN/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Open Neovim and run the plugin manager:

```vim
:PackerSync
```

## Plugins

This configuration uses **lazy.nvim** for plugin management. Key plugins include:

- **nvim-treesitter**: Advanced syntax highlighting and code parsing.
- **lspconfig**: Configurations for the built-in LSP client.
- **Telescope**: A powerful fuzzy finder.
- **nvim-cmp**: Auto-completion framework.
- **LuaSnip**: Snippet engine for Neovim.

Explore `init.lua` for a full list of plugins.

## Keybindings

Keybindings are set up to improve efficiency:

- `Space` is the leader key.
- `Ctrl+p`: Fuzzy file finder.
- `Ctrl+h/j/k/l`: Navigate between splits.
- `gd`: Go to definition.
- `gr`: Rename symbol.

Refer to `lua/keybindings.lua` for the full list.

## Customization
